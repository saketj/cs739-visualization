This effect is due to charge trapping or breakdown of the gate oxide. As the oxide becomes a less effective insulator, it is easier to move the charge across it onto the gate. The same phenomenon is also responsible for the eventual failure of the cell, since it also makes it easier for the charge to leak off the floating gate.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The paper concludes that based on the observations in the paper, one can design intelligent FTLs and data encoding schemes that can increase the longevity of the flash device.</li> </ul>",

      "paper-highlights": "<p>This research focuses on understanding flash memory error patterns and demonstrates distinct error patterns, along with detailed analyses. It classifies four different types of errors seen from controller's point of view:</p> <ul> <li><em>Erase error</em> &ndash; happens when an erase operation fails to reset the cells to the erased state. This is mainly due to manufacturing process variations or defects caused by trapped electrons in the tunnel oxide after stress due to repeated P/E cycles.</li> <li><em>Program interference error</em> &ndash; happens when the data stored in a page changes (unintentionally) while a neighbouring page is being programmed due to parasitic capacitance-coupling.</li> <li><em>Retention error</em> &ndash; happens when the data stored in a cell changes over time. The main reason is that the charge programmed in the floating gate may dissipate gradually through the leakage current.</li> <li><em>Read erro</em>r &ndash; happens when the data stored in a cell changes as a neighboring cell on the same string is read over and over.</li> </ul> <p>Further, it makes following observations about these errors:</p> <ul> <li>An SLC can tolerate ~10k program/erase (P/E) cycles while a 2-bit MLC can only survive for ~3k P/E cycles for 30-40 nm. The available P/E cycles are expected to decrease even more in the near future as flash cells continue to scale down in size and more than 2 bits are programmed per cell.</li> <li>The P/E cycle-dependence of errors can be explained by the deterioration of the tunnel oxide under cycling stress. During erase and program operations, the electric field strength across the tunnel oxide is very high (e.g., several million volts per centimeter). Such high electric field strength can lead to structural defects that trap electrons in the oxide layer. Over time, more and more defects accumulate and the insulation strength of the tunnel oxide degrades. As a result, charge can leak through the tunnel oxide and the threshold voltage of the cells can change more easily. This leads to more errors for all types of flash operations.</li> <li>There is a significant error rate difference between various types of errors. The long-term retention errors are the most dominant; their rate is highest. The program interference error rate ranks the second and is usually between error rates of 1-day and 3-day retention errors. The read error rate is slightly less than 1-day retention error rate, while the erase error rate is only around 7% of the read error rate.</li> <li>Retention error rates are highly dependent on retention test time. If the time before we test for retention errors is longer, the floating gate of flash memory is more likely to lose more electrons through leakage current.</li> </ul>",
      "paper-observations": "<p>This is one of&nbsp;the first papers that empirically analyzes error patterns in 3x-nm flash memory. The new observations of this paper beyond previous work were:</p> <ol> <li>They characterized and analyzed errors in modern flash memory from flash controller&rsquo;s point of view, categorizing them into four types: erase errors, program interference errors, retention errors and read errors.</li> <li>They showed the relationship between various types of errors and demonstrated empirically using real 3x-nm flash chips that retention errors are the most dominant error type.</li> <li>They demonstrated that different flash errors have distinct patterns: retention errors and program interference errors are P/E-cycledependent, memory-location-dependent, and data-value-dependent.</li> <li>They were the first to empirically demonstrate the location dependency of retention errors and program interference errors.</li> <li>They described the underlying circuit and device-level mechanisms that results in the observed error patterns. Since the observed error patterns are due to fundamental circuit and device behavior inherent in flash memory it is&nbsp;expected that their observations and error patterns will also hold in flash memories beyond 30-nm technology.</li> </ol>"
